            <title>Who We Are?</title>
            <p>A successful project requires many people to play many roles.
               Some members write code or documentation, while others are valuable
               as testers, submitting patches and suggestions.
            </p>
            <p>The team is comprised of Members and Contributors. Members have
               direct access to the source of a project and actively evolve the
               code-base. Contributors improve the project through submission of
               patches and suggestions to the Members. The number of Contributors
               to the project is unbounded. Get involved today. All contributions
               to the project are greatly appreciated.
            </p>
