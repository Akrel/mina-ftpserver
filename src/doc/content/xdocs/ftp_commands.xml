                <p>A new command &quot;LANG&quot; is added to the FTP command set to allow
                   server-FTP process to determine in which language to present server

                <title>LIST [pathname]</title>
                <p>This command causes a list to be sent from the server to the
                   passive DTP.  If the pathname specifies a directory or other
                   group of files, the server should transfer a list of files
                   in the specified directory.  If the pathname specifies a
                   file then the server should send current information on the
                   file.  A null argument implies the user's current working or
                   default directory.  The data transfer is over the data
                   connection. This command must be preceded by a PORT or PASV 
                   command.

                   to be created as a directory (if the pathname is absolute)
                   or as a subdirectory of the current working directory (if
                   the pathname is relative).

                <p>This command causes a directory listing to be sent from
                   server to user site. The pathname should specify a
                   directory or other system-specific file group descriptor; a
                   null argument implies the current directory.  The server
                   will return a stream of names of files and no other
                   information.

                   transfer command. The response to this command includes the
                   host and port address this server is listening on.

                <title>PORT &lt;host-port&gt;</title>
                <p>The argument is a HOST-PORT specification for the data port
                   to be used in data connection.  There are defaults for both
                   the user and server data ports, and under normal
                   circumstances this command and its reply are not needed.  If
                   this command is used, the argument is the concatenation of a
                   32-bit internet host address and a 16-bit TCP port address.
                   This address information is broken into 8-bit fields and the
                   value of each field is transmitted as a decimal number (in
                   character string representation).  The fields are separated
                   by commas.  A port command would be: <br/><br/>
