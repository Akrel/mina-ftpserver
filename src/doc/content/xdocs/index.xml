            <title>Overview</title>
            <p>The Apache FTP Server is a 100% pure Java FTP server. We have designed 
              it to be a complete and portable ftp server engine solution based on 
              currently available open protocols.
            </p>
            <p>It is also a FTP application platform. We have developed a Java API 
               to let you write Java code to process FTP event notifications that 
               we call the Ftplet API. Apache FTP Server provides an implementation 
               of FTP server to support this API.
