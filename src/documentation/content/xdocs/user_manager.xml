            <p>
               The default user manager is properties file based. All the user 
               informations (login, password, home directory, upload/download rate etc.) are stored in 
               <u>user.properties</u> file. The default user manager class is <u>org.apache.ftpserver.usermanager.PropertiesUserManager</u>
               If you want to use different user manager, please change the <u>user-manager</u> block in <u>assembly.xml</u> file.
            </p>
            <p>
               You can encrypt the password in properties based user manager by specifying 
               <u>encrypt</u> key in <u>config.xml</u> file. The encryption algorithm is MD5.
            </p>
            <p>
               <font color="red">If you are using property file based default user manager, 
               make sure that the user properties file is not accesible by the FTP users. Otherwise it will be 
               a security problem. Keep it below the user virtual root directory.</font>
            </p>
            <p>
               You can change the default user manager or even write your own user manager
               by implementating <u>org.apache.ftpserver.usermanager.UserManagerInterface</u> class. 
               You have to specify your user manager class (fully qualified) in the assembly file too.
